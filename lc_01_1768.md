### Exploring Alternative Strategies for Merging Strings

The initial solution, which iterates up to the length of the longest string, is a perfectly valid and intuitive way to merge two strings alternately. However, in software design, exploring different algorithmic patterns is key to understanding trade-offs in readability, efficiency, and elegance. Let's examine a few other common approaches to this problem.

#### 1. The Two-Pointer Method

A classic and highly versatile technique in algorithm design is the use of two pointers. Instead of a single loop counter, we maintain a separate pointer (or index) for each string. We then advance them independently as we consume characters. This approach is often more explicit about how each data source is being traversed.

**Algorithm:**

1.  Initialize an empty result string.
2.  Initialize two pointers: `p1` at the start of `word1` (index 0) and `p2` at the start of `word2` (index 0).
3.  Loop as long as either pointer has not reached the end of its respective string.
4.  Inside the loop:
    *   If `p1` is still within the bounds of `word1`, append the character `word1[p1]` to the result and increment `p1`.
    *   If `p2` is still within the bounds of `word2`, append the character `word2[p2]` to the result and increment `p2`.
5.  Once the loop finishes, both strings have been fully processed. Return the result.

#### 2. Loop and Append Remainder

This strategy optimizes the process by separating the problem into two distinct phases: merging the common portion and appending the leftover tail. This can be more efficient as the main loop contains no conditional `if` checks, leading to more predictable execution. The logic is clean and easy to follow.

**Algorithm:**

1.  Initialize an empty result string.
2.  Determine the length of the shorter string (`min_len`).
3.  Iterate from `0` up to `min_len`. In each iteration, append the character from `word1` and then the character from `word2`. This loop handles the perfectly alternating part.
4.  After the loop, identify the remaining portion.
    *   If `word1` is longer than `word2`, append the rest of `word1` (from `min_len` to the end) to the result.
    *   Otherwise, if `word2` is longer, append the rest of `word2`.
5.  Return the completed result string.

#### 3. The Queue-Based Approach

For a more abstract perspective, we can treat the strings as streams of characters using a Queue data structure (First-In, First-Out). This approach decouples the merging logic from array indices entirely, focusing instead on consuming from two sources until they are both empty.

**Algorithm:**

1.  Initialize an empty result string.
2.  Create two queues, `q1` and `q2`.
3.  Populate `q1` with all characters from `word1` and `q2` with all characters from `word2`.
4.  Loop as long as either `q1` or `q2` is not empty.
5.  Inside the loop:
    *   If `q1` is not empty, dequeue (remove and get) the front character and append it to the result.
    *   If `q2` is not empty, dequeue its front character and append it to the result.
6.  Return the result string.

Each of these methods successfully solves the problem, but they represent different ways of thinking: the **Two-Pointer** method focuses on simultaneous traversal, the **Loop and Append** method focuses on separating concerns, and the **Queue-Based** method provides a high-level, stream-processing abstraction.
